# Aniket Gode - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About

Hi, I'm Aniket, a Data Analyst with a Master's in Data Science and a Bachelor's in Computer Science. With a solid technical background and expertise in generating actionable insights, I specialize in risk-based oversight, machine learning, and data mining. Proficient in Python, R, SQL, and advanced Excel, I leverage artificial intelligence and optimize business processes to drive innovation and identify opportunities. I am passionate about using data to uncover insights and deliver impactful business solutions. I have hands-on experience with master data management, data visualization (Power BI, Tableau), and machine learning models, along with a strong enthusiasm for learning new technologies.

In my previous roles, I worked on analyzing Amazon reviews, social media marketing, AI ethics, and predictive modeling. I am also skilled in time-series analysis, NLP, and developing predictive models. My goal is to continuously grow as a data professional and contribute my expertise to help organizations solve complex problems through data-driven decision-making.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring advanced machine learning algorithms and building interactive dashboards for various business use cases.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will briefly describe data analytics projects, the technologies I used, and the skills applied to solve each case.

## Fake News Detection
- Goal: To classify whether a news article is fake or real using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
- Code: https://github.com/anigode/Fake-news-detection
- Description: This project involved the implementation of a classification model that uses NLP to detect fake news. I applied machine learning models to process and classify a dataset of news articles.
- Skills: NLP, data preprocessing, classification models.
- Technology: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib.
- Results: Achieved 95% accuracy using Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
## Hybrid Movie Recommendation
- Goal: To recommend movies based on user preferences using collaborative filtering and content-based techniques.
- Code: https://github.com/anigode/Hybrid-Movie-Recommendation-System
- Description: This project focused on creating a movie recommendation system. I combined collaborative and content-based filtering to predict movie preferences for users.
- Skills: Data cleaning, machine learning, recommendation systems.
- Technology: Python, Cosine Similarity, Matrix Factorization, Pandas, Seaborn.
- Results: Achieved 95% accuracy in predicting movie ratings for over 20 million records.
- ## E-commerce Data Analysis
- Goal: To forecast future sales for an e-commerce store using time-series analysis.
- Code: https://github.com/anigode/E-commerce-Data-Analysis
- Description: This project involved analyzing sales data and applying time-series forecasting models to predict sales. The ARIMA model was used to forecast sales with high accuracy.
- Skills: Time series analysis, ARIMA, data visualization.
- Technology: Python, ARIMA, Pandas, Matplotlib.
- Results: Achieved a 95% accuracy rate in a 30-day sales forecast, leveraging daily transaction data from over 1,000 customers.
## Study of Improving Social Media Marketing Using Data Mining
- Goal: To optimize social media marketing strategies using data mining techniques.
- Code: https://github.com/anigode/Data_Analysis-of-Youtube-data-using-youtubev3-API
- Description: This project involved applying decision trees and deep learning algorithms to improve marketing strategies. The goal was to optimize key marketing strategies and reduce report generation time.
- Skills: Data mining, decision tree, deep learning, data visualization.
- Technology: Python, R, Power BI, API.
- Results: Elevated the model’s F1, Accuracy, and Precision score from 72% to 87%, identified four key marketing strategies, and reduced reporting time by 35%.
## Diabetes Detection
- Goal: To develop a machine learning model to predict diabetes outcomes.
- Code: https://github.com/anigode/Diabetes-Detection
- Description: Built a predictive model using decision tree, random forest, and logistic regression algorithms. Focused on feature scaling and data preprocessing to improve accuracy.
- Skills: Machine learning, data preprocessing, decision tree, random forest, logistic regression.
- Technology: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib.
- Results: Optimized prediction accuracy by 80% using feature scaling and data preprocessing on a dataset of 768 records.
## Multi-Class Classification of Tweets
- Goal: To classify tweets into multiple categories based on their content.
- Code: https://github.com/anigode/Multi-class_Classification_of_Tweets
- Description: This project involved applying TF-IDF for feature extraction and text preprocessing. I used sentiment analysis APIs to classify and analyze a dataset of 50,000 tweets.
