# Aniket Gode - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About

Hi, I'm Aniket, a Data Analyst with a Master's in Data Science and a Bachelor's in Computer Science. With a solid technical background and expertise in generating actionable insights, I specialize in risk-based oversight, machine learning, and data mining. Proficient in Python, R, SQL, and advanced Excel, I leverage artificial intelligence and optimize business processes to drive innovation and identify opportunities. I am passionate about using data to uncover insights and deliver impactful business solutions. I have hands-on experience with master data management, data visualization (Power BI, Tableau), and machine learning models, along with a strong enthusiasm for learning new technologies.

In my previous roles, I worked on analyzing Amazon reviews, social media marketing, AI ethics, and predictive modeling. I am also skilled in time-series analysis, NLP, and developing predictive models. My goal is to continuously grow as a data professional and contribute my expertise to help organizations solve complex problems through data-driven decision-making.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring advanced machine learning algorithms and building interactive dashboards for various business use cases.

- Technology: Python, R, Power BI, API.
- Results: Elevated the model’s F1, Accuracy, and Precision score from 72% to 87%, identified four key marketing strategies, and reduced reporting time by 35%.
## Diabetes Detection
- Goal: To develop a machine learning model to predict diabetes outcomes.
- Code: https://github.com/anigode/Diabetes-Detection
- Description: Built a predictive model using decision tree, random forest, and logistic regression algorithms. Focused on feature scaling and data preprocessing to improve accuracy.
- Skills: Machine learning, data preprocessing, decision tree, random forest, logistic regression.
- Technology: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib.
- Results: Optimized prediction accuracy by 80% using feature scaling and data preprocessing on a dataset of 768 records.
## Multi-Class Classification of Tweets
- Goal: To classify tweets into multiple categories based on their content.
- Code: https://github.com/anigode/Multi-class_Classification_of_Tweets
- Description: This project involved applying TF-IDF for feature extraction and text preprocessing. I used sentiment analysis APIs to classify and analyze a dataset of 50,000 tweets.
